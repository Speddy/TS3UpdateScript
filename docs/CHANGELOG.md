	* Reduced distance between command and description in help menu
	* Removed tab before 'Creating Backup of existing TeamSpeak 3 server'

	+ Added support for IPfire
	+ Added cronjob support for IPfire

	* Fixed non-working pokes

### Version 3.10.1

	* Set absolute path for TEMP_* files of the script

	* Fixed issue with detecting installed release and binary, cause of not installed 'telnet' package
	* Renamed sentence 'Latest version is already installed. Nothing to do!' to 'Latest release is already installed. Nothing to do!'

	* Renamed all 'LATEST_VERSION' variables to 'LATEST_STABLE_RELEASE'
	* Adjusted detection of latest stable release

	! You have to create this file, if it does not exists
	+ Added support for new dbPlugin 'MariaDB'
	! Since TeamSpeak server version 3.0.11 (Build 1408694433) was the MySQL database replaced by the fork MariaDB (read CHANGELOG of TeamSpeak server version 3.0.11 and newer)
	! If the script is updating from version 3.0.10.3 (Build 1388593719) to 3.0.11 or newer, it also will update your MySQL database to MariaDB
	+ If MySQL/MariaDB database is used, the script will also detect the database username, password and database (used for updates and database fixes)
	! Add your IP address, which is used for connecting as ServerQuery to query_ip_whitelist.txt or the script is may not able to detect your installed version, because it is banned by the server
	! Do not check to often the same instance or you will get banned by the instance!

	* Fixed non-working script update
	* Set raw-GitHub link for better searching for the latest script version
	* Outsourced TS3UpdateScript update mechnism to own script: .updateScript.sh
	! ATTENTION: Do *NOT* execute the script manually - it's your own risk! Use instead ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --update-script

### Version 3.5.1

	! No code was changed! Be sure, that you've installed the package 'ca-certificates' for fetching the latest script version - for further details execute 'apt-cache show ca-certificates'

### Version 3.5

	* Fixed issue with DDoS-Protection of TeamSpeak - the script is now able to identify the latest version (replaced teamspeak.com with teamspeak.de)
	* Changed download mirror from 'files.teamspeak-services.com' to 'dl.4players.de' for server files (reason: files.teamspeak-services.com does not exists anymore)
	+ Added check, if a TeamSpeak server is installed anyway
	*/! Changed default eMail address of 'displayed_user_name.txt', because I've received very much eMails from other servers, which are not owned by me (I've deleted all eMails)
	+ Added '7. Debugging' part to 'INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt'
	+ Added parameter '--latest-version' - if you are a hoster and want to test the latest version first, you are now able to say the script, that you specify the latest version (just write the version string in a file and tell the script, that you want to us it. Example: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients --latest-version /home/demoLab/latestStableVersion.txt)
	* Adjusted Backup/Rollback feature - you could now run more than one TS3UpdateScript.sh process at the same time, because the backups are saved under '/tmp/ts3server_backup/root/of/installed/ts_server/'

	! Do you have any further suggestions or bugs? Write me an eMail to mail@ts3-tools.info or open a new topic in the forum: http://www.forum.ts3-tools.info/

### Version 3.3

	+ Added status "In Progress" to the actual todo of the script: [ .. ] -> [ OK ] or [ FAILED ]
	* Changed example E-Mail address from file 'administrator_eMail.txt'
	! Please set your OWN E-Mail address! I don't want to receive your E-Mails. ;)
	! HINT: If you change the E-Mail(s) from file 'administrator_eMail.txt', you have to reinstall your cronjob!

	* Adjusted checks for given parameters (you are now able to set the parameters in an order like you want)
	! You need to replace the '=' with a 'space' in parameters, which are using it. For example: Instead "./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate=no" use "./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate no"
	! You can use each parameter in each order ;)
	- Removed not needed code, cause of adjusted parameter checks
	* Adjusted output of "help" page: './TS3UpdateScript.sh --help' or './TS3UpdateScript.sh -h'
	+ Added E-Mail function: Cronjob will send you an E-Mail with the output of the script
	! To use the E-Mail function, you have to provide your E-Mail address in following file: administrator_eMail.txt
	* Adjusted cronjob - it is an own file now (/etc/cron.d/TS3UpdateScript) and will not edit your existing cronjob/crontab file of root
	+ Added functionality to ignore given clients for poke messages

	* Moved code for searching the latest TeamSpeak 3 server version a bit higher, that it can be used for some other code
	+ Added support for update texts: You are now able to use the variable $VERSION to display the latest TeamSpeak 3 server version
	! An example for the update text is shown in the default text file and in the INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt

	! You need to run the script once, that the 'password-file' file is copied to each directory: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check

	+ Added text-files for update messages (auto_update_text.txt and update_text.txt)
	! If you want your own information text for online clients, you have to edit these two files
	! You need the package/software 'sed', if you want to inform your online clients
	* '--inform-online-clients' will now poke each client and not send a global message, because the most users don't read server messages, but pokes for sure
	* '--autoupdate=yes' will save all parameters now
	* Adjusted waiting time (from 5 seconds to 10 seconds) to check, if TeamSpeak 3 Server is still running

	* ts3server_startscript.sh: COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS '${2}' will be replaced with 'ts3server.ini', if the ts3server.ini file exists or the MySQL database is used
	+ Added option '--path' to set a static TeamSpeak 3 server path
	+ Added TS3UpdateScript update function
	! You will need a further software package therefore: unzip
	* Adjusted software package checks
	+ Added feature to set your own poke message sender name: displayed_user_name.txt
